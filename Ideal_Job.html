My ideal job would be something in programming specifically AI, these things are appealing to me because
<br/>
I like the idea of creating a program that does a job, especially one that can make decisions for itself
<br/>
to some degree. I enjoy the feeling of finishing coding and seeing the final product do what you had in
<br/>
in your head properly.

<p
I would have to have a few years experiencein programming a few different languages, and probabaly
<br/>
a masters degree, I only have learned from a couple of subjects through the bachelor of IT, I have 
<br/>
a bit of knowledge in java from that, and what I've learned from self teaching (google, youtube videos etc).
<br/>
but I hope to eventually achieve something like this:
