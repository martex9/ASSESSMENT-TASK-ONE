Overview 
</b>
 </center>
</p>
<p
<br/>
<center>
The project will be an epilepsy monitoring smartphone application that will examine multiple 
<br/>
variables before during and after a seizure. It will track these variables and input them into a graph 
<br/>
format for easy viewing purposes.
<br/>
The application is designed to consider the variables in isolation and combination. The purpose is to
<br/>
 gather as much information about the variables to provide an indication to the person who has the 
<br/>
seizure what maybe causing the seizures. It may also be of assistance to doctors and medical teams
<br/>
 in assisting in minimising seizure activity. The person can then make changes to their lifestyle to 
<br/>
improve their overall health and wellbeing.

<b>
Motivation
</b>
 </center>
</p>
<p
<br/>
The motivation behind this is that there is a lot of cases of epilepsy out there, I myself suffer from it. 
<br/>
I’m sure people would like an application that helps track their seizures and helps them try and find 
<br/>
a way of improving their health. 
<br/>
In Australia, around 250,000 people are currently diagnosed with epilepsy, that's over 1 per cent of 
<br/>
the population. Also, around 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy, this makes it one of the 
<br/>
most common neurological illnesses. Given this information I think this epilepsy monitoring 
<br/>
application would be practical and convenient, and a lot of people would get considerable use out it 
<br/>
if it were to become a major market application.

<h1> Monitoring Application </h1>
<br/>
This epilepsy monitoring application will have data inputted by the epileptic and/or person 
<br/>
witnessing the seizure and the application will convert it to a table or graph format. The application 
<br/>
will then show: 
<br/>
•	Seizure time – The time of day the seizure began and ended, so the information can be later 
<br/>
compared to find out if there are links or common ground between the seizures.
<br/>
•	Seizure duration – The amount of time the seizure lasts for. The longer the seizure time the 
<br/>
worse the case for the epileptic/seizure sufferer because of loss of air and damage to the 
<br/>
brain.  
<br/>
•	Temperature – A well known trigger of seizures is overheating so temperature is an 
<br/>
inclusion.
<br/>
•	Was there an aura beforehand? – Often epileptics will feel an aura to indicate a seizure may 
<br/>
be about to happen. This will be recorded following any seizure and/or after recovery time.
<br/>
•	Time from aura to beginning of seizure – This will be important information likely to be
<br/>
 provided by an observer. It will give the epileptic/seizure sufferer an idea of how long to 
<br/>
prepare for a seizure and make themselves safe. It may also give them time to alert an 
<br/>
observer. The more this information is gathered over time the more accurate the timing 
<br/>
might be.
<br/>
•	Time taken to recover from seizure – This will give an idea to observers or medical personnel 
<br/>
the amount of time before the sufferer returns to full consciousness. This may also point to 
<br/>
the severity of a seizure. 
<br/>

•	Seizure triggers – In addition to those already mentioned, other seizure triggers that may be 
<br/>
included in the information gathered are changes in medication, lack of sleep, alcohol and 
<br/>
drug use (including caffeine), other illnesses, flashing bright lights or patterns, diet and over
<br/>
exertion. The sufferer may have known individual triggers that can be customised inputs into 
<br/>
the application, such as environmental influences. For example, some sufferers may be 
<br/>
affected by lunar phases.
<br/>


		

The recording of the relevant information may provide insights into the cause of the individuals 
<br/>
seizures, their timing, when and where they might occur and other important medical information.

<h1> Medication and Seizure Alerts </h1>
<br/>
The application will include a list of medication which can be changed at any time by the sufferer or
<br/>
 anyone else who is allowed access.

<br/>
There will be two modes for seizure alerts one that is a basic aura alert and one that is an emergency
<br/>
aura alert that sends a message to a predetermined group of family/friends. If the sufferer is alone 
<br/>
and/or feeling vulnerable to seizures, they can they set the mode to high alert on the home screen 
<br/>
of the smartphone. This will give the family and friends the opportunity to check on the sufferer. At 
<br/>
any time, the sufferer can reset the application back to standard mode. This might be when they’re 
<br/>
no longer alone or are not feeling vulnerable or haven’t had any seizures in a long time.

Tools and Technologies
</b>
 </center>
</p>	

<p
<br/>
<center>
<br/>
I would just use a basic PC to design this smartphone application like the one I own now. I would 
<br/>
either use MIT app inventor because it’s easy to use/ learn or just learn a bit more Java 
<br/>
programming and code it in that and design an android application. I think the application would run 
<br/>
smother and there would be more creative opportunity if it were to be created in Java rather than 
<br/>
MIT app inventor but would require a lot more work and effort to build. I have done some work in 
<br/>
Java but never designed a smartphone application so some extra study would be required.

Skills Required
</b>
 </center>
</p>

<p
<br/>
<center>
<br/>

There will be no special hardware/software required to make this smartphone application just the 
<br/>
knowledge of programming in a certain language on a PC, this for me will be Java as I already know a 
<br/>
bit about it as mentioned in Tools and Technologies. The only special software I can think of is one 
<br/>
that will convert the application from the PC to the smartphone design. To find the skills required I 
<br/>
will just need to do a little more research on smartphone application design in Java.

<b>
Outcome
</b>
 </center>
</p>

<p
<br/>
<center>
<br/>
If the project were to become successful it could literally save lives, people would have better 
<br/>
knowledge of their triggers, what time of day they have seizures, how long it takes after an aura for
<br/>
 the seizure to start and most importantly alert the sufferers family/friends when they are having a 
<br/>
seizure. All sorts of problems will be solved because the sufferer will find themselves more relaxed 
<br/>
being alone and in different environments knowing that at the push of a button, they can call upon 
<br/>
people to come help them. Not only will they be able to graph their information and data, they can 
<br/>
use it to their advantage at any given time.
