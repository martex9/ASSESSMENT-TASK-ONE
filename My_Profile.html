<br/>
I have always had an interest in IT even from a young age. I always like keeping up with the
<br/>
latest technology/software available and playing the newest video games.
<br/>
I think my biggest interest is in progamming as I would like to be behind the scenes
<br/>
creating the lastest software. I have a passion for AI, I like the idea behind it,
<br/>
the idea that computers are intelligent and maybe one day could be as intelligent 
<br/>
as humans (or more).
<br/>
I don't have too much actual knowledge in this field yet though iv'e done a couple 
<br/>
of subjects in the bachelor of IT (Introduction to programming, and programming 1).
<br/>
I'm all signed up for the bachelor now and starting with this subject because
<br/>
it's one of the core subjects.
