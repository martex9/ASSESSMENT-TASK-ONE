It would seem to me that I am a big thinker, creative, and quite intellectual. A lot of my learning comes from auditory means which
<br/>
suggests that my main way of gathering information is listening, and learning from what I hear.
<br/>
I am an Introvert very reserved but a thought oriented person also. I am great at solving problems, I am able to see the big picture
<br/>
and consider wider ideas and insights.

I think I would be able to work well in a team with these results, even though I’m thought orientated
  <br/>
I would still be able to come up with logical answers to problems that the team may face.

  Find people that with other skill sets that mix well with mine and make
  <br/>
up a team. These could be people of many different varieties as long
  <br/>
as they go well with what I’m doing and how I’m doing it.
