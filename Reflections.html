It would seem to me that I am a big thinker, creative, and quite intellectual. A lot of my learning comes from auditory means which
<br/>
suggests that my main way of gathering information is listening, and learning from what I hear.
<br/>
I am an Introvert very reserved but a thought oriented person also. I am great at solving problems, I am able to see the big picture
<br/>
and consider wider ideas and insights.

<br/>
I would still be able to come up with logical answers to problems that the team may face.
