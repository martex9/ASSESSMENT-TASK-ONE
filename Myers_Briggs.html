• What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular
<br/>
event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).

I have always had an interest in IT even from a young age. I always like keeping up with the
<br/>
latest technology/software available and playing the newest video games.
<br/>
I think my biggest interest is in progamming as I would like to be behind the scenes
<br/>
creating the lastest software. I have a passion for AI, I like the idea behind it,
<br/>
the idea that computers are intelligent and maybe one day could be as intelligent 
<br/>
as humans (or more).
<br/>
I don't have too much actual knowledge in this field yet though iv'e done a couple 
<br/>
of subjects in the bachelor of IT (Introduction to programming, and programming 1).
<br/>
I'm all signed up for the bachelor now and starting with this subject because
<br/>
it's one of the core subjects.

• Why did you choose to come to RMIT?  
</b>

<p

I chose to come to RMIT because I think it's a very respectable university, and can 
<br/>
give me all the things I need in the area I want to study (IT). I looked at a few 
<br/>
different universitys and RMIT seemed to be the one that suited my needs the best.
<br/>
I also like that it might lead me to further study in this area such as a masters 
<br/> 
degree or something like that.

• What do you expect to learn during your studies?  
</b>
</center>
</p>

<p
<br/>
<center>
In this Introdction to IT I expect just to learn the basics of IT, but over the whole 
<br/>
bachelor I expect to learn a vast amount of of knowledge that will get me into
<br/>
the field of IT. I want to learn as much as possible, and I think this will help
<br/>
me do that as there is a wide variety of subjects in the bachelor. I like
<br/>
programming and I hope to learn a lot about that.
